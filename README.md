# CaaS - Cipher as a service! 🔐
Hey there! I bring to you the world's first CaaS - Cipher as a service!

## Getting to know CaaS
API link: `https://cipher-as-a-service.herokuapp.com/api/caesar/{key}/{message}`
Just type in your key value and plain text message in the above URL respectively and >bam< you get the encrypted value right inside your project. 
Demo: **[https://cipher-as-a-service.herokuapp.com/api/caesar/3/demotext](https://cipher-as-a-service.herokuapp.com/api/caesar/3/demotext)** would give you the caesar encrypted value of **demotext** , key being 3.

## The web version
There is even a web version of my CaaS which is accessible at "https://cipher-as-a-service.herokuapp.com/"

### Contribute
Feel free to contribute to this project by adding in more ciphers and functionalities.
